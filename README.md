<h1><span style="font-size:30px;>Project Scope</span></h1>

Synthetic Data creation: Generate a synthetic dataset representing students, mentors, and institutions. 

AI Recommendation Model Development:  Maching algorithms using machine learning models such as KNN, XGBoost, and Random Forest. 

Data Integration: Integrate diverse datasets – including majors, scholarships, interests, and QS rankings –as input features for the recommendation system. 

Prototype Implementation: A user interface is developed to visually present recommendation results. 

Evaluation: Model performance is compared using accuracy and relevance metrics (nDCG@3, diversity, interpretability).
