<h1><span style="font-size:30px;>Overview</span></h1> 

In today’s globally connected education landscape, international students often face difficulties due to an overwhelming number of choices and complex procedural systems. The current study abroad system has been criticized for being too general and lacking scalability, which prevents it from providing personalized guidance personalized to each student’s needs. 

To address these issues, this project supports TriumphED’s mission by developing an AI-powered system that provides personalized study pathway recommendations and mentor matching. The system automatically analyses diverse datasets – including majors, scholarships, visa types, and admission requirements – to generate personalized recommendations that suit each student’s goals, such as university admission, PhD, or migration-oriented programs. Furthermore, it goes beyond simple institutional matching by connecting students with mentors who share similar backgrounds, helping them adapt more effectively to their chosen regions or cultures.  

The value of this project lies in integrating AI-driven analysis with human experience-based guidance, enabling students to make better, more informed decisions in their educational journey. 

 

 

<h1><span style="font-size:30px;>Project Scope</span></h1>

Synthetic Data creation: Generate a synthetic dataset representing students, mentors, and institutions. 

AI Recommendation Model Development:  Maching algorithms using machine learning models such as KNN, XGBoost, and Random Forest. 

Data Integration: Integrate diverse datasets – including majors, scholarships, interests, and QS rankings –as input features for the recommendation system. 

Prototype Implementation: A user interface is developed to visually present recommendation results. 

Evaluation: Model performance is compared using accuracy and relevance metrics (nDCG@3, diversity, interpretability).
